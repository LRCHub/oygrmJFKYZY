[00:00.05] If you don't wanna see me
[00:12.55] 
[00:02.73] Did a full 180, crazy
[00:08.06] Thinking 'bout the way I was
[00:10.54] Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
[00:15.70] But look at where I ended up
[00:29.70] 
[00:19.46] I'm all good already
[00:21.37] So moved on, it's scary
[00:23.41] I'm not where you left me at all, so
[00:41.41] 
[00:28.38] If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
[00:36.15] If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
[01:00.15] 
[01:30.01] Don't show up
[01:32.03] Don't come out
[01:33.91] Don't start caring about me now
[01:37.97] Walk away, you know how
[01:41.89] Don't start caring about me now
[01:57.39] 
[01:45.09] Aren't you the guy who tried to
[01:50.49] Hurt me with the word goodbye?
[01:52.92] Though it took some time to survive you
[01:58.03] I'm better on the other side
[02:12.03] 
[02:01.78] I'm all good already
[02:03.65] So moved on, it's scary
[02:05.64] I'm not where you left me at all, so
[02:23.64] 
[02:10.60] If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
[02:18.50] If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
[02:25.62] (Don't, don't, don't)
[02:36.12] 
[02:25.88] Don't show up
[02:26.15] Don't come out
[02:28.02] Don't start caring about me now
[02:29.21] Walk away, you know how
[02:32.82] Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)
[03:00.82] 
[02:43.79] Up, up
[02:43.87] Don't come out, out, out
[02:45.25] Don't show up, up, up
[02:45.54] Don't start now (oh)
[02:45.91] Up, up
[02:46.95] Don't come out, out
[02:47.40] I'm not where you left me at all, so
[03:05.40] 
[02:51.48] If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
[02:52.86] If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
[03:16.86] 
[03:12.38] Don't show up (don't show up)
[03:14.24] Don't come out (don't come out)
[03:16.28] Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
[03:20.22] Walk away (walk away)
[03:22.15] You know how (you know how)
[03:24.16] Don't start caring about me now (so)
[03:42.16] 
[03:25.81] Up, up
[03:25.95] Don't come out, out, out
[03:28.05] Don't show up, up, up
[03:28.43] Walk away, walk away (so)
[03:28.88] Up, up
[03:28.94] Don't come out, out, out
[03:29.29] Don't show up, up, up
[03:29.62] Walk away, walk away, oh
